I&#39;m not so sure, I&#39;ll have to check in the back.&#34;  Karen: &#34;Ugh, hurry up then.&#34;  Guy goes in the back to look for the milk, but instead of looking for the milk, he peeks out the door to get short glimpses of Karen&#39;s milk jugs  Guy starts touching himself, eventually unzipping his pants to start stroking his meat  Camera pans to Karen&#39;s body, occasionally zooming in on Guy&#39;s face and pp, because fuck you  Karen, after busting through the door: &#34;UHH HELLO? WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG!?!?&#34;  Guy, quickly grabbing a bag of frozen chicken nuggets to cover his junk: &#34;Uhh ummm nothing! I&#39;m just looking for your milk!&#34;  Karen, while grabbing the back of nuggets: &#34;THAT&#39;S NOT MILK, THESE ARE NUGGETS YOU DUMBASS&#34;  The guy does a death grip on the bag, desperately trying to hide his junk  Karen pulls it hard enough to break the guy&#39;s grip, exposing his hard cock  Karen does that trademark Brazzers shocked face. You know, the one everyone makes on PornHub ads. You know what the fuck I&#39;m talking about  Karen: &#34;What the fuck???&#34;  The guy: &#34;No no no, it&#39;s not what it looks like! Please don&#39;t call my manager!&#34;  Karen walks away, but slips, and the guys penis magically slips inside of her  They start fucking  The porn ends with the manager walking in and saying &#34;What the fuck???&#34;  Edit: if you make porn and are gonna use this can you just put my username somewhere in there please. It will be like the ultimate bragging right." (Wasteland (55, 35, 2))

Ai quando eu tava indo chegou um NCR, e o adam que era outlaw, eles decidiram ajudar ja que todos eles tinham briga com a legion, e eu tava sendo contratado. Quando chegamos la a base deles estava reforçada e o Alex tava na frente. Tentei conversar com ele e ate pedi para ele se render, ja que o problema nao era com ele, ele pediu ajuda no radio e eu atirei. matamos ele e invadimos, chegou o pessoal de fora e a gente matou.

Por semelhanças de opiniões a respeito dos Legionários, se juntaram em torno de três membros para ir ao campo. Quando dito para se render, &#34;você&#34; havia recusado e então os despachado. Uma dúvida é dada, você usou o rádio para a chamada de reforços antes do conflito? Eles haviam ofertado rendição ou algo do tipo?
